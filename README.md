# SchoolyardSkirmish
A 3rd person video game with turn based combat mechanics with an intense focus on crafting and looting to use one's weapons and abilities.

Schoolyard Skirmish will follow the player who is in high school who recently moved into a new town. This town has two high schools who are at war with each other. The player goes to one of those schools and becomes a key asset in turning the tide against the rival class!

Our game uses typical turn-based combat mechanics, but with a twist; every attack, every action, requires the appropriate resources. Instead of something like a Mana Pool or a SP Bar, the player and their party has access to items that are consumed with their respective attacks and actions. For instance, in order to use something like a water gun, the player must have access to the water gun and it must have the appropriate amount of water contained within it in order to perform the action the player wants to do with it. The player can also follow up with a tazer, which combos well with enemies that are wet, but the tazer must have the charge necessary to be used. 

As mentioned above, enemies, as well as allies and the player themselves, can be set up for combo attacks, much like technicals in a game like Persona 5. When a certain status effect is placed on a character, there will be other damage or effect types that will combo well with the original status effect, leading to some strategic plays!

Looting and crafting will play a key role in Schoolyard Skirmish. The player will want to loot the environment for items and weapons. Since almost every item has a limited number of uses that correspond to certain things, like the amount of AA Batteries the player has in their inventory, our game encourages and even requires a wide range of strategies and play styles, because no one single set of items will be able to be used throughout the game. The player will often find new, never-before-seen items in lockers and chests that they will have to eventually use when their current stock of weapons and items are used up. 

We have many more interesting ideas up our sleeves, so stick around and follow our progress as we update our game!
